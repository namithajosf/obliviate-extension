### Project Description
Obliviate is a productivity-focused Chrome extension that helps users stay focused by tracking time spent on productive and distracting websites. It features a Pomodoro-style break timer and productivity scoring.

### The Problem Statement
In today’s digital age, distractions are everywhere. Users often lose track of time on unproductive websites, leading to decreased productivity and focus. Obliviate solves this by helping users monitor their browsing habits and take regular breaks.

### The Solution
Obliviate categorizes websites as **productive**, **distracting**, or **neutral**, tracks time spent on each, and provides a productivity score. It also includes a break timer to encourage regular breaks, improving focus and productivity.
